This is an R Markdown document (.Rmd). R Markdown files are useful for writing up reports; specifically if you want to integrate code and commentary or analysis. To display R code inside an .Rmd doc, we create a code chunk:

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
print("Hello World")
```

The options  `eval = TRUE` and `echo = TRUE` tell the .Rmd doc to run the code chunk and print the output in the .Rmd file. 


Next, I'll do the same as above except I will tell R **not** to print out my input:
```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
print("Hello World")
```

Next let's generate 1000 observations from a N(0,1) distribution and print the histogram of the data with 100 bins.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
data <- rnorm(n = 1000, mean = 0, sd = 1)
hist(data, n = 100)
```

Finally, to convert this entire .Rmd doc to a .pdf or .html file, click "Knit>Knit to pdf" or "Knit>Knit to html" at the top of the source file window.
